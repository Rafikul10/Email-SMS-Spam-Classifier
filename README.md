Email communication has become crucial in today’s world. Email spam is a kind of unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email. A common terminology to describe an email as not spam is “Ham”, meaning an email is either Ham or Spam. Classify here if a message is Spam or not.

**Conclusion :**

It took me almsot more than one day to build this model, beacuse it take long time to to train all model. Accuracy of the model is more than 96%. So, in future i will try to improve the model in a better way for classifying spam and ham messages. If you have any suggestions for improve the model in better way please let me know here is my Email handle - rafikul.official10@gmail.com  

Thank You!❤️
